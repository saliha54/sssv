>This repository is created for the **[Osoc 2020](https://summerofcode.be/)**  and build by *HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS , ReactJS and NextJS (**MERN Stack***).
One of the major outcomes of this project is figuring out how to create, explore and run a web application in a development environment, then deploying it to the production environment under **Test-Driven-Development(TDD)** approach. 

>**Fitigai** comes from a combination of fitness and Ikigai. Ikigai is a Japanese philosophy that means finding your meaning in life 

> **Fitigai** application is about finding a sports coach near to you. The Fitigaï app makes it accessible to everyone to easily find a suitable coach. We paid attention to keyboard navigation, screen readability, and color blindness. It is mobile friendly and available in several languages. 

>Our main goal was not to deliver a fully-featured web application, but instead to create a minimum viable product in 4 weeks. We had to work in an environment where Covid-19 measures were in place. That means, we had to work remotely, but that shouldn't hamper our development process. To overcome the side-effects of remote working, we set-up daily working sessions between team members and used the benefit of collaborative coding.

## Technology-Tool-Stack
- **NextJS** : NextJS is a JavaScript framework created by Zeit. It allows building server-side rendering and static web applications using React, thus enabling SEO friendliness.
- **NodeJS** : Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
- **ExpressJS** : Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.[3] It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
- **Axios** : Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser that also supports the ES6 Promise API. 
- **Bootstrap** : Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a document database with query and index scalability and flexibility.
- **Vercel** : Vercel is the creator of Next. js and a platform that enables users to develop, preview, and ship Jamstack sites.
- **Heroku** : Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.
