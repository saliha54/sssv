# :football: Osoc 2020 Fitigai Project

>This repository is created for the **[Osoc 2020](https://summerofcode.be/)**  and build by *HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap, MongoDB, Express, NodeJS , ReactJS and NextJS (**MERN Stack***).
One of the main outcomes of this project is figuring out how to create, explore and run a web application in a development environment, then deploying it to the production environment in accordance with **Test-Driven-Development(TDD)** approach. 

**Fitigai** comes from a combination of fitness and Ikigai, which is finding your meaning of life. 

> **Fitigai** application is about finding a sports coach near to you.The Fitigaï app makes it accessible to everyone to easily find a suitable coach. We payed attention to keyboard navigation, screen readability and color blindness. It is mobile friendly and available in several languages.

## Technology-Tool-Stack
- **NodeJS** : Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.
- **MongoDB Atlas** : Cloud-hosted MongoDB service on AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. With MongoDB Atlas, your self-healing clusters are made up of geographically distributed database instances to ensure no single point of failure. MongoDB Atlas makes it easy to control access to your database. Your database instances are deployed in a unique Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) to ensure network isolation.
- **MongoDB Compass**: The GUI for MongoDB. Visualize, understand, and work with your data through an intuitive GUI. Modify your data with a powerful visual editing tool. Understand performance issues with visual explain plans, view utilization and manage your indices.
- **Mongoose** : Provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model our application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building.
- **ExpressJS** : Express.js, or simply Express, is a web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs.[3] It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.
- **JWT** : JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
- **Bcrypt** : Bcrypt is a password hashing function designed by Niels Provos and David Mazières, based on the Blowfish cipher, and presented at USENIX in 1999. The bcrypt function is the default password hash algorithm for OpenBSD[2] and other systems including some Linux distributions such as SUSE Linux.
- **React** : React. js is an open-source JavaScript library that is used for building user interfaces specifically for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.
- **Axios** : Axios is a Javascript library used to make HTTP requests from node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser that also supports the ES6 Promise API. 
- **Bootstrap** : Bootstrap is a potent front-end framework used to create modern websites and web apps. It's open-source and free to use, yet features numerous HTML and CSS templates for UI interface elements such as buttons and forms. Bootstrap also supports JavaScript extensions.
